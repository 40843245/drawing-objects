#### data labels NOT be displayed if their value is greater than the maximum value defined for the chart's axis

-   **Cleaner Chart Appearance:**

By hiding labels that extend beyond the axis limit, the chart can appear less cluttered and more focused on the data within the defined range.

-   **Preventing Misinterpretation:**

Displaying labels far beyond the axis maximum might visually distort the scale and potentially lead to misinterpretations of the relative values.
